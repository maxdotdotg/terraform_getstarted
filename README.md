# Terraform Getting Started
Originally, this was me walking through the terraform getting started docs, and commiting my work as I go. Once I finished the getting started docs, I felt like I needed more, so I started working through the [Terraform Up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920061939.do) book. 

To keep them separate and to be able to draw on both, I'm using two branches: `getting_started` for the official docs, and `up_and_running` for the book.

After I work through the book, the next step will be getting familiar with [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest).
